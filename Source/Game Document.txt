Main tasks:
	Resource expansion (generation/transportation/storage)
	Migration system (including structure building)
	Update army system
	Pathfinding

Step 1: Base
Take food/people from other types on same point for structure
Add pathfinding and faster or only movement if on road


Step 2: System
Add resource system
	Implement generation of resources on map
	Have forests expand over time
	Resources
		Wood
		Stone
		#Iron
Limit construction further
	DONE: No constructions on mountains and forests
	#No road on mountain -- Cost more?
Check if road already exists before building
#No roads overlapping but build into the crossing road?
DONE: Roads to anywhere
DONE: Fix more general roads
Update army transport code
Solve inbalances by migration
#Seasons
#Water
#Add moral system -- Not needed?


Graphic
	Load textures
	Draw rectangles
	Draw lines
	Zoom in/out
	transparent textures
	Draw text
	Draw map
	Hud rectangles
Input
	W/A/S/D -> move
	Scroll	-> zoom/scale
	Left	  -> confirm/select
	Right	  -> regret
	Q/E  -> select farm<->city<->structure<->army
	Numbers
		1 -> build road
		2 -> build farm
		3 -> build city (must be on center of a farm)
Logic
	Entitys
		Farm field
			Have population
			Food generation
		City field
			Have population
#			General storage
			Unit production
		Quarry
			Have population
			Limited food storage
			Stone generation
		Lumber camp
			Have population
			Limited food storage
			Wood generation
		Road
#			Can be made of stone
		Army
			Soldiers
				Limited food storage
			Carts
				Transportation storage
			Can
				transport cargo
				move/kill population
				destroy entitys
	Resources
		Food
#		Wood
#		Stone


Rules
	Farm generate food
	Farm require labor
	City collects food
	City require labor
	City constructs units
#	Unit construction increases population_needed
	Quarry generate stone
	Quarry require mountain
	Lumber camp generate wood
	Lumber camp require forest

	Construction require labor
#	City construction require tree
#	Road construction may require stone

	Population/Units consume food
	Population generate labor



Step 3: Game
Add other teams
Implement simple AI
Add interaction with AI (diplomacy)
Implement combat
#Height map
#other graphical enchantments
#Network (multiplayer)


Step 4: Rough polish
