DONE: Restructure input code
DONE: Limit construction further
	DONE: No roads to themself

DONE: Add interface for
	DONE: construction of units
	DONE: supply management
	DONE: select unit
	DONE: move unit
Add pathfinding and faster movement if on road
Change roads to use rectangles with textures
Add select highlightning


Graphic
	Load textures
	Draw rectangles
	Draw lines
	Zoom in/out
	transparent textures
	Draw text
	--Select highlightning
Input
	W/A/S/D -> move
	Scroll	-> zoom/scale
	Left	  -> confirm/select
	Right	  -> regret/order
	Numbers
		1 -> select
		2 -> build road (must start from center of city)
		3 -> build farm (must be on end of road)
		4 -> build city (must be on center of a farm)
Logic
	Entitys
		City/Village/Farm
			Farm field
				Food storage
			City field
				Food and Money storage
		Road
		Units
			Soldiers
				Food and/or Money storage
			Carts
				Food and/or Money storage
		Army
			Contains units
	Food
	Money


Rules
	Farm generate Food
	City generate Money
	City consume Food
	Soldier consume Food
	Soldier consume Money
	Building Road/Farm/City/Soldier consume Money





Step 2:
Add road construction
Add moral system
Implement starving
Add resource system
	Add map
	Implement generation of resources on map
	Have forests expand over time
	Resources
		Tree
		Rock
Limit construction further depending on map
#Population system

Step 3:
Add other teams
Implement simple AI
Add interaction with AI (diplomacy)
#Height map
#other graphical enchantments
